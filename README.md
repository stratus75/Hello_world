# Hello_world
This is the tut for setting up my first Github account !
This is my first Github readme file! hopefully ther will be a lot more relating to the Mycroft project. But it is going to be a long road and a steep learning curve some may say I'm mad and maybe i'am but never know unless i try (and prove my sanity in the process loll)
